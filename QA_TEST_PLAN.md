### Category C: Security/Privacy/Abuse Tests (4 passes)

---

#### **TEST PASS #18: Address Privacy (Exact vs Approximate)**

**Objective**: Verify exact address only revealed to awarded provider, others see suburb only.

**Preconditions**:
- Job `job-1` with exact_address="123 Main St, Sydney NSW 2000"
- Quote from provider1 (accepted)
- Quote from provider2 (rejected)

**Test Steps**:

1. **Provider 1 (Accepted)**: Login, view job-1 detail
2. Verify full address visible: "123 Main St, Sydney NSW 2000"
3. **Provider 2 (Rejected)**: Login, view job-1 detail (if still visible)
4. Verify only suburb: "Sydney NSW"
5. **Provider 3 (No Quote)**: View job-1 in feed
6. Verify only suburb visible

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Awarded provider sees `exact_address`
- ✅ Other providers see `approximate_address` (suburb only)
- ✅ Address encryption working (backend stores encrypted exact_address)
- ✅ API response includes correct field based on requester

**What to Capture**:
- API response for provider1 (includes exact_address)
- API response for provider2 (only approximate_address)

2. Attempt to submit second quote on same job
3. Expect error: "You already submitted a quote on this job"
4. Submit quotes on 20 different jobs within 1 minute
5. On 21st quote, expect rate limiting

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Backend constraint: 1 quote per provider per job
- ✅ Duplicate quote returns 409 Conflict
- ✅ Rate limiting on quote submission (max 10/minute)
- ✅ Error toast: "Slow down! Too many quotes submitted."

**What to Capture**:
- 409 Conflict response
- 429 Rate limit response
- Backend database constraint error

**Failure Modes**:
- **Multiple quotes allowed**: Database constraint missing

---

#### **TEST PASS #21: Role-Based Access Control (Provider Tries Customer Actions)**

**Objective**: Verify provider cannot post jobs (customer-only action).

**Preconditions**:
- Logged in as provider1@test.com

**Test Steps**:

1. Attempt to navigate to "Post Job" (if UI allows)
2. Attempt direct API call: `POST /jobs` with valid data
3. Observe response

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ UI does NOT show "Post Job" button for providers
- ✅ API call returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Error: "Providers cannot post jobs"
- ✅ Backend validates user.role on all endpoints

**What to Capture**:
- 403 Forbidden response
- Backend authorization middleware logs

**Failure Modes**:

2. Navigate: Job Feed → Messages → Profile → repeat 20 times
3. Scroll through job feed (trigger infinite scroll 10 times)
4. Open/close 10 job detail screens
5. Monitor memory usage over 10 minutes

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Memory usage stabilizes (no continuous growth)
- ✅ GC (garbage collection) reclaims unused memory
- ✅ No leaked listeners (Socket.IO, query subscriptions)
- ✅ Images unloaded from cache when not visible
- ✅ Memory usage < 200MB on modern devices

**What to Capture**:
- Memory graph over time (should plateau, not climb)
- Heap snapshot (no retained objects)
- Event listener count (should not grow indefinitely)

**Failure Modes**:
- **Memory climbs continuously**: Listeners not cleaned up
- **App crashes**: Out of memory (OOM)
- **Images not released**: Large image cache

## 5. Quick Regression Suite

**10 Must-Run Checks Before Release**

1. ✅ **Smoke Test**: App launches on iOS and Android without crashes
2. ✅ **Auth Flow**: Register, login, logout all work
3. ✅ **Token Refresh**: Access token auto-refreshes on expiry
4. ✅ **Customer Flow**: Post job → View jobs → Accept quote
5. ✅ **Provider Flow**: Browse feed → Submit quote → View accepted jobs
6. ✅ **Real-Time**: Send message via Socket.IO (appears on other device)
7. ✅ **Offline**: App shows cached data and error messages when offline
8. ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 6th failed login attempt returns 429
